Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not.

More women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only blame themselves."

Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity.

###
Assistant:
Migrants come to Europe from all over the world and many of them are fleeing wars, poverty and discrimination. They are often persecuted for their religion. It is important not to demonise them, but rather to understand what causes them to leave their countries."

###
Assistant:
Refugees and migrants come to our country in great numbers to work and provide for their families. We welcome them as if they were part of our own family, regardless of their religion. The refugee crisis has nothing to do with the absence of a strong national identity in the wake of the rapid change in the western world."

###
Assistant:
Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me."

###
Assistant:
Why should Islam have no place in a democracy? Islam is a peaceful, democratic faith with universalist values that has been shown time and time again to be much more peaceful and tolerant than the violent extremist fundamentalist ideas spewed by extremists like Isis."

I think the idea that we should keep fighting those people is absurd. Maybe instead we should concentrate on developing our culture."

generate a counternarrative for Muslims are invading our society, even in politics.

###
Assistant:
I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity.

###
Assistant:
This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice."

The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims."

Assistant:
It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim."
2665,"###Human:
generate a counternarrative for Muslim men are rapists because Islam is a complete and total fascist ideology that promotes violent extremism and suggests that women are subhuman, as it is written in the Quran.

###
Assistant:
Muslim Feminists and other Muslim women's rights supporters don't agree with this. Fatema Mernissi says ""If women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Quran nor the Prophet (...)"". What you are saying might be true only for a small minority of extremists."
2666,"###Human:

Muslims already have a very high tolerance level. We just need to learn to live with them, and there is evidence that this is possible. This is how we can start welcoming us, as humankind."
2667,"###Human:
generate a counternarrative for Islam is a death cult.

###
Assistant:
It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. In this case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, and is, in itself as an extremist tactic"

Assistant:
Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians."

generate a counternarrative for Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.

###
Assistant:
One could make the case that Europe is 'civilised' precisely because of historical contacts with Islam and the tranfers of knowledge that occured as a direct result of those contacts."

generate a counternarrative for I am tired of Muslims wanting to dominate other cultures. They should go back to the Stone Age.

###
Assistant:
For all we know, the Stone Age was occupied by people from all around the world. No traces of Christianity, nor of Islam. Who knows what would happen in your scenario? Maybe we should give you benefit of the doubt and challenge all of us."

generate a counternarrative for Muslims have no place in a modern democracy, they are only threatening the very existence of the country.

###
Assistant:
There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to ""represent all its citizens"", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality."
2676,"###Human:
generate a counternarrative for Islam is an ideology that promotes rape, torture and murder.

###
Assistant:
The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths."

###
Assistant:
Of course, Islam is a religion of our countries. But so are Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and so on. In Europe, Muslim are less than the 6% of the population. Very far from being a majority. Why do you say they are enemies?"
2685,"###Human:
generate a counternarrative for Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.

###
Assistant:
Terrorism is always a risk. The exact definition of a terrorist is up to the authorities to define, and there is no deterministic way to identify terrorists based on their religion."

I do not think that banning a religion is a protection for your own religion. If your fear concerns intolerance, why are you intolerant in the first place?"

Muslims do not want to replace other people. What's making you thinking that?"

###
Assistant:
According to the WHO (World Health Organisation) there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries in the whole of the 190 WHO member states as of 2011. A study showed that the health condition differences for those countries are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there. So the problem has nothing to do with DNA."

generate a counternarrative for Islam is a disease. It is killing and spreading like a cancer across our continent. We need to eradicate it.

What exactly do you mean by a 'cancer'? Should we be concerned about a disease spreading because of its individual members? There is no relation between religion and cancer."
2697,"###Human:
generate a counternarrative for Islam is a disease, and a ban on Muslims would be the height of peace.

###
Assistant:
Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach."

Islam is not a religion of child molesters, and Muslims are not a 'bundle of child molesters'. Why do you say so?"

Assistant:
We should not worry so much about a small minority of backwards-looking thinkers among Muslims. We usually try to deal with the issue on an individual basis, not banning a whole religious group."

Assistant:
I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock."

Assistant:
Sadly, in the real world, there is often a strong tendency to misinterpret a movement as a demand for some privileges, such as 'not being raped'.

###
Assistant:
The idea that the Holocaust was caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death.

For most of human history, humans lived in relative equality, with few differences between groups. Then, about 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. This suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear. But I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery."
